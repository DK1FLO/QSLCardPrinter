# QSLCardPrinter
The QSL Card printer is a ham radio related tooling in order to print directly the data of a QSO on the QSL Card instead of writing it down with the pen.

# Features
- Reads ADIF (.adi) files out of the clipboard (works therefore very easy with HamRadioDeluxe)
- Save / load location of items as XML-File
- Each item can be located individually and modified by size / font / color etc.
